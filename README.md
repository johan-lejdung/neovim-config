# Neovim Config

This is my personal neovim config, it will probably always a work in progress.
I started with the modular kickstarter, original readme is still present.

Todo:

- [ ] Since my Alt is taken by Aerospace, rebing move line/selection up and down
- [ ] Setup Frontend
- [ ] Setup treesitter for Bruno
- [ ] Setup diffview? https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim
